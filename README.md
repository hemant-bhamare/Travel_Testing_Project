# Travel Project - Automated Testing Framework

This is an automation testing project created using Selenium WebDriver and TestNG to test a travel site form at [phptravels.com/demo](https://phptravels.com/demo/).

## Project Overview

This includes both positive and negative test cases for comprehensive coverage.

- Java (JDK 1.8)
- Selenium WebDriver
- TestNG testing framework
- Maven for dependency management
- WebDriverManager for browser driver management
- Chrome and Edge browsers supported
- Page Object Model (POM) design pattern
